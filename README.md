# `@bomb.sh/nucleus`

This package is the internal CLI for our org. It provides:
- standardized `dev` command (`node --strip-types`)
- standardized `build` command with `esbuild`
- standardized `test` command
- standardized `lint` and `format` commands
- standardized `tsconfig` settings
- an opportunity to dogfood our packages
